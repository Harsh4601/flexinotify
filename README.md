# Smart Notification System
### Project for CSE 570 Wireless and Mobile Networks

## Overview
This project aims to create an intelligent notification management system that adapts to user context and device capabilities. By leveraging smartphone sensors and implementing smart filtering algorithms, we enhance the user experience by delivering the right notifications at the right time.

## Features

### 1. Context Recognition Using Sensors
- Utilizes smartphone sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope)
- Detects real-time user activities (e.g., commuting, relaxing)
- Adapts notification delivery based on user context

### 2. Smart Notification Management
- Filters incoming notifications based on priority
- Delivers critical alerts immediately
- Batches non-essential notifications for later review
- Reduces notification fatigue and improves focus

### 3. Adaptive User Interface Design
- Implements a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- Ensures consistency across devices
- Enhances accessibility for all users

## Getting Started

### Build and Run FlexiNotify App
1. Connect an Android device via USB or configure an emulator through the AVD Manager in Android Studio.
2. Press the **Run** button on the toolbar to compile and launch the app.
3. Choose a deployment target device when prompted.
4. Monitor the app's behavior and interactions with the Android system in real-time.
